## Hi guys :blush:

I'm Kenny Cuevas and I'm from the Dominican Republic. I am a Software Engineering student at Apec University and this repository was created to hold everything related to my learning in Java and I have created a 90 day challenge practicing to see how I can improve on my path to becoming a backend developer. I am a newbie, be patient.

I have taken different pages, videos, oracle documentation and other things to guide me in learning.
### VIDEOS
- [*Java Tutorial for Beginners [2020] from Programming with Mosh*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34).
- [*Java full course | Java Tutorial For Beginners [2021] NEW*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgl81fPcLc8).
### WEBS
- [*Learn Java | CodeAcademy*](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [*Java Tutorial*](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [*Disco Duro de Roer*](https://www.discoduroderoer.es)
### JAVA DOCUMENTATION
- [*The Java Tutorials*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

I will be adding different pages or other ways for me to take to continue learning as time goes by. 

### [Also take as a more centralized learning guide on the backend the following roadmap:](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
